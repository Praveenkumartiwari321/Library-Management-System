# Library-Management-System
The Simple Library Management System project aims to develop a user-friendly software application
using C++. The system is designed to assist librarians in efficiently managing books and tracking their
availability. It offers various features such as adding new books, searching for books, issuing books to
students, returning books, listing all books, and deleting books from the system.
This project provides an excellent opportunity for students to apply their knowledge of data structures,
including arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues, in a practical scenario. Additionally, students will gain 
hands-on experience in implementing essential algorithms for searching and sorting, such as binary
search, linear search, quick sort, and merge sort.

Features:
1. Add New Books:
The librarian can easily add new books to the system by providing details like unique ID, title,
author, and status (available or issued). The book data can be stored using an array or linked list data
structure.
2. Search for a Book:
The system allows the librarian to search for a book by its title or ID. A search algorithm, such as
binary search for sorted books or linear search for unsorted books, can be implemented to find the desired
book. If found, the system displays the book's details.
3. Issue a Book:
When a book is issued to a student, the system updates its status from available to issued. It also stores 
the relevant details of the student to whom the book has been issued. To manage book issues efficiently,
a stack or queue data structure can be utilized.

4. Return a Book:
When a student returns a book, the system updates its status from issued to available. The system also
removes the details of the student to whom the book was issued, ensuring accurate book tracking.
5. List All Books:
The librarian can view a comprehensive list of all books in the library. To present the books in a sorted 
manner, a sorting algorithm like quick sort or merge sort can be implemented based on criteria such as
ID or title.
6. Delete a Book:
The librarian has the ability to delete a book from the system. If a linked list data structure is employed
for storing books, removing a node from the linked list will accomplish this task.
